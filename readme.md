# CppTemplateLibrary
A set of data structure templates a made over the years as programming practice

- ``scoped_ptr.h``
A smart strong pointer with deep copy, auto-delete, and a safe weak pointer

- ``Array.h``
An array with an enumerator

- ``List.h``
A doubly-linked queue with vector-like operations and an enumerator

- ``AvlSortedSet.h``
A logarithmic sorted set and sorted map using the AVL BST model

- ``Skiplist.h``
A probabilistic sorted set and sorted map using the skiplist model

- ``Table.h``
A two-dimensional array

- ``TableBuilder.h``
A smart way to build two-dimensional arrays

- ``Matrix.h``
A two-dimensional matrix with mathematical matrix operations

- ``Rational.h``
An ordered pair that represents a ratio, with mathematical operations

- ``Complex.h``
An ordered pair that represents a complex number, with mathematical operations

- ``Modular.h``
Numeric types with modular arithmetic
